# Mars Probe

Simple project to exercise my python knowledge.

How to run:
```
$ python3 houston.py
```

Some commands examples:
```
5 5         -> Create a 6x6 terrain
1 2 N       -> Create a probe on position 1,2 facing north
LMLMLMLMM   -> Move the probe
```

After starting the script, just write the commands and press enter. After entering all commands just press enter again.

## Known issues:
* The UI sometimes display the probe on a incorrect position.
* Missing tests (Should add some soon)
